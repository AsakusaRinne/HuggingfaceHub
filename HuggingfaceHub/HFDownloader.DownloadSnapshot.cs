        /// Download a whole snapshot of a repo's files at the specified revision. This is useful when you want all files from
        /// a repo, because you don't know which ones you will need a priori. All files are nested inside a folder in order
        /// to keep their actual filename relative to that folder. You can also filter which files to download using
        /// `allowPatterns` and `ignorePatterns`.
        ///
        /// If `localDir` is provided, the file structure from the repo will be replicated in this location. You can configure
        /// how you want to move those files:
        ///   - If `localDirUseSymlinks=null` (default), files are downloaded and stored in the cache directory as blob
        ///     files. Small files (<5MB) are duplicated in `localDir` while a symlink is created for bigger files. The goal
        ///     is to be able to manually edit and save small files without corrupting the cache while saving disk space for
        ///     binary files. The 5MB threshold can be configured with the <see cref="HFGlobalConfig.LocalDirAutoSymlinkThreshold"/>.
        ///   - If `localDirUseSymlinks=True`, files are downloaded, stored in the cache directory and symlinked in `localDir`.
        ///     This is optimal in term of disk usage but files must not be manually edited.
        ///   - If `localDirUseSymlinks=False` and the blob files exist in the cache directory, they are duplicated in the
        ///     local dir. This means disk usage is not optimized.
        ///   - Finally, if `localDirUseSymlinks=False` and the blob files do not exist in the cache directory, then the
        ///     files are downloaded and directly placed under `localDir`. This means if you need to download them again later,
        ///     they will be re-downloaded entirely.
        ///
        /// An alternative would be to clone the repo but this requires git and git-lfs to be installed and properly
        /// configured. It is also not possible to filter which files to download when cloning a repository using git.
